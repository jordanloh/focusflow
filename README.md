# Welcome to FocusFlow! ðŸ‘‹

Our ultimate goal is for FocusFlow to become the go-to productivity and wellness companion for students and professionals alike â€” a daily platform that helps users stay focused, manage their academic or work-related responsibilities, and maintain balance in their lives.
FocusFlow aims to be more than just a focus timer. We are building a productivity wellness ecosystem that enables users to:
- Track focused screen time on work-related applications
- Manage academic tasks and deadlines effectively
- Use integrated tools like to-do lists, Pomodoro timers, and flash cards for optimised study/work sessions
- Stay engaged through a gamified progress system, where users earn in-app currency by completing productivity goals
- Spend that currency to enhance a personalised backyard â€” a cosmetic, customisable space that grows with their productivity
